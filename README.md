# SKYJUMP Pou Clone (V01):
#### This project is a clone of the minigame "Sky Jump" of the mobile video game "Pou".
It is made in C++ using the SDL3 library to manage the window and rendering.
<br></br>
<br>Here is an example of what it looks like the original minigame:</br>

# In this version:

You can move left and right and go out of the bounds while jumping.
<br/>
You can manually add platforms (it isn't implemented in an intuitive way, yet).

---
# How to run:

You must have SDL3 installed.
<br/>
Make sure that you have all the .hpp, .cpp, and SDL3.dll files.
<br/>
It is recommended to manage all the files with Visual Studio.

# What I have learned?:
- I've learned how to manage events in SDL.
- I've learned how to make a simple platform video game prototype with SDL window and rednderer.
- I've learned how to detect collisions with platforms (only by jumping above it).
