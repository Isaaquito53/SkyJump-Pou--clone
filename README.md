# SKYJUMP Pou Clone (V01.3):
#### This project is a clone of the minigame "Sky Jump" of the mobile video game "Pou".
<br>
It is made in C++ using the SDL3 library to manage the window and rendering.
</br>
<br>Here is an example of what it looks like the original minigame:</br>

# What have I learned?:
- I've learned how to manage events in SDL.
- I've learned how to make a simple platform video game prototype with SDL window and rednderer.
